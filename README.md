I started this project from The App Brewery's Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp by Angela yu, 
check out the full course at [www.appbrewery.co](https://www.appbrewery.co/). It's the best course for who wants to  be a great Flutter Developer(cross-platform Android/Ios).

this is the original project from The App Brewery ![flash-chat-flutter](https://github.com/londonappbrewery/flash-chat-flutter)

## My Goal

I wanted to learn more about Firebase with  Flutter and how to deal with firestore storage so i added more screens and features like:<br/>

1.  Firebase authentication verify email. <br/>
2.  Setting screen (update user data(nickname,age,description).<br/>
3.  Profile screen (show user's infromation).<br/>
4.  Drawer widget (to easy navigate through screens).<br/>
5.  Online screen (show app's users).<br/>
6.  Private chat screen (chat with a partner).<br/>
7.  Send images <br/>
8.  Splash screen (added in android).<br/>


## adding new widgets

 *  clipPath<br/>
 *  drawer<br/>
 *  AlertDialog<br/>
 *  FutureBuilder<br/>
 *  ShadeMask<br/>
 *  RadialGradient<br 
 *  ...<br/>
